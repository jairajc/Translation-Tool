# Translation-Tool
Creating a general translation tool using Google Translator as the base and integrating datasets from Doccano and using Flask to create your web application

1. Understanding the Components
      
        Google Translator: This will be the core of my translation engine. I'd use the Google Translate API for integrating translation capabilities into my tool.
        Doccano: It's an open-source annotation tool that will provide datasets. The important part is to understand how to export or access these datasets, typically in JSON format or similar.
        Flask: A lightweight Python web framework that I'll use to create your web application. It will serve the web pages and handle the backend logic.

2. Setting Up Your Development Environment
        Install Python and Flask.
        Set up a virtual environment for the project to manage dependencies.
        Ensure you have access to Google Cloud and the Translate API, and set up API keys.
        Install Doccano or set up a way to access its datasets.

3. Designing the Application
        Sketching out the UI for our web application â€“ how users will interact with it, where the original and translated texts will be displayed, etc.
        Plan how the Flask app will handle requests, interact with Google Translate, and process Doccano datasets.

4. Building the Flask Application

        Backend:
        Set up Flask routes to handle API requests.
        Implement a function to pull data from Doccano. This could be through an API which Doccano offers, or by reading files from a given path.
        Integrate the Google Translate API to translate the text.

        Frontend:
        Create HTML templates for your web pages.
        Use JavaScript (I did't) to manage dynamic content on the client side, like sending requests to your Flask backend and updating the web page with translated text.

5. Deployment

      After everything works as expected, I deployed the Flask app. Options include Heroku, AWS, or a similar cloud service.
